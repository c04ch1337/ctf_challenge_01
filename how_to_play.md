# How to Play CTF Challenges

## What is a CTF?
Capture The Flag (CTF) is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve challenges to find hidden "flags." These flags are often strings of text hidden in vulnerable systems.

## Tools and Methodologies
1. **Web Exploitation**: Use tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and browser developer tools.
2. **Directory Brute-Forcing**: Use tools like Dirbuster or Gobuster to find hidden directories.
3. **Password Cracking**: Use tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat.
4. **Reverse Engineering**: Use Ghidra or IDA Pro for binary analysis.
5. **Scripting**: Write custom scripts in Python, Bash, or other languages to automate tasks.

## Getting Started
1. Access the CTF server at `http://localhost:81`.
2. Explore the web application and look for vulnerabilities.
3. Use the tools and methodologies mentioned above to find the flags.
4. Submit the flags to the competition admin to score points.
